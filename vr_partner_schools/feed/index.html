This was forwarded to us and we were able to connect him and his classmates with the tech.

<h2>Istituto Tecnico Industriale &#8220;Galileo Ferraris&#8221;</h2>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vr.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vr-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="550" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1512" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vr-169x300.jpg 169w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vr-576x1024.jpg 576w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vr-17x30.jpg 17w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vr.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></a><br />
In early July, I was really excited for VR, the HTC Vive had come out barely 3 months before and the hype for the new technology, especially for us developers, was really high.</p>
<p>I’m a 12th grade student here in Italy, and I started thinking on how I could get my hands on a Vive to work with my class during my last year.  That&#8217;s the main reason why I contacted Gabe Newell, with very little hope and a big dream.  I remember spending 2 days, thinking of the words I could use to express my feelings about VR and how I wanted to be a part of such a big thing with my classmates, all developers like me.</p>
<p>After sending the email, I was pretty sure I wouldn&#8217;t get answered, why should someone care about a school developer group and their dreams? But I was quite wrong.  Later that day, at 8:00 PM here in Italy, I received a mail from Lisa Castaneda (Co-Founder and CEO of foundry10) in which she told me that Gabe forwarded her my mail and that the foundry10 team was really interested in the things we made here.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes and in the following conversations, I explained everything that we could have do here. I explained our position, but I’m just a student and their target was a teacher, so the technology could be experienced by as many student as possible. In less than 3 days they gave me full trust, something I couldn&#8217;t believe, and sent me the HTC Vive. </p>
<p><i>[Note from foundry10 team: we encourage all who are interested in learning and VR to reach out.  It is our policy to at least have a teacher or organization official as an advisor, and we did connect with a teacher at ITI, but Luigi was (and remains) the main driver.]</i></p>
<p>I then spent the entirety of August planning the best way to get the newly founded VR class to experience the technology. The teachers, students, and everyone involved were really excited to try VR and see what it is all about.</p>
<p>So, September came and the 12th grade year started. We began by trying to gather as many resources as possible, asking our principal for a new PC to make this work, and in the meantime we studied Unity to do our part as developers.  In order to get this computer, the VR group worked really hard to learn the engine.  Eventually we participated in and won a competition called &#8220;The Big Hack&#8221; in early October. Our principal was really happy with our work, and he was very willing to help us get the tools we needed.</p>
<p>By November everything was ready, so finally the class got to experience what VR is all about. It can be difficult for newcomers to understand how someone can be somewhere else, like space or a mage&#8217;s tower, just by putting a helmet on their head.</p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waltz-of-the-wizard.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waltz-of-the-wizard.jpg" alt="" width="1328" height="747" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1505" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waltz-of-the-wizard.jpg 1328w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waltz-of-the-wizard-300x169.jpg 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waltz-of-the-wizard-768x432.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waltz-of-the-wizard-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/waltz-of-the-wizard-30x17.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1328px) 100vw, 1328px" /></a></p>
<p>However, everyone really enjoyed it, it was one of the most fun times we had all year.  Some got to experience Waltz of the Wizard, the thrill of being a wizard was something they won&#8217;t forget easily.  Some other students wanted to experience the thrill of a Rollercoaster VR run with No Limits 2 Rollercoaster Simulator and, while a few got motion sickness, they all really enjoyed their time, they were like babies experiencing reality for the very first time, interacting with everything and everyone like they never had before.</p>
<p>They all had, by the end, the smile of something fresh, of inspiration, of the future, it was a blast.  Even more exciting was the fun we had in the next months when we started developing for it!</p>
<p>With our GPO (management and company design) teacher we started organizing as a group, so we could all give our best while we worked as a real company. This gave us a shot at finding out what working in a development team was like while we developed in a platform we really enjoyed.</p>
<p>We had a deadline for our content, it was the 23rd February of 2017, and we were in January.</p>
<p>The first thing we did was brainstorm content ideas, almost everyone pitched an idea for a total of 22 by the end of the brainstorm.</p>
<p>The main 3 ideas we selected were:</p>
<p>-A space walking simulator, but we ruled it out because we really didn&#8217;t know how to program well yet in Unity, and we wouldn&#8217;t have made it for the deadline.</p>
<p>-Escape the room VR, based on some informatic base, but it still required too much work for our deadline and we really had to show we were working by the end of it.</p>
<p>-A school simulator, where we could try to rebuild our school on the inside based on assets on the Unity Assets Store and program some part, like archery or basketball.  We also wanted to include a little cinema where you could watch a clip of a project we made to support Parkinson‘s disease cures.</p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/school-model-1.png"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/school-model-1-300x133.png" alt="" width="451" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1507" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/school-model-1-300x133.png 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/school-model-1-768x341.png 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/school-model-1-1024x455.png 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/school-model-1-30x13.png 30w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></a></p>
<p>We settled down on the last idea, it was the one we could make in a relatively fast time while looking good on design.</p>
<p>First of all, we started with the assets. Part of the team worked on textures while others tried to implement new models on the basic layout of the school we have. Then the programming group, the one I took part in, worked on the SteamVR API, the bow system, the object grabbing system, and the physics of some objects (like the basketball). Finally, we had the sound engineers work on sampling, our studio audio for the school, basic school sounds (like items dropping), and the Parkinson clip sound.</p>
<p>We experienced the collaborative elements of co-working in a company, used new platforms to share the project, and while it got very rough overtime, we were able to manage it all, and overcome all problems that came our way.</p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vex.png"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vex.png" alt="" width="591" height="332" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1504" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vex.png 591w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vex-300x169.png 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vex-30x17.png 30w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></a></p>
<p>Finally we needed a name, and we decided on VEX (which stands for Virtual Experience, our fantasy wasn&#8217;t really on the names!).  Eventually we all came to really like it, because while in some ways it sounded very basic and dumb, in other ways it sounded professional, so we stuck with it.</p>
<p>The experience really helped us consolidate as a good work group, and helped us construct a shared objective in ways we never thought of before!</p>
<p>Time passed by and we arrived at the end of February (before the deadline) with the ALPHA 0.1 of the Vex Project. It was so satisfying to know that we did it and that we could, after a break for study (we still have exams to do by the end of the year), try to improve it more in all ways we can imagine.  For example: improving performance(it runs at about 60 fps, but we&#8217;re working on reaching the target 90 fps for VR), adding a chemistry lab, adding a computer lab, and an electronic-puzzle lab/minigame that we&#8217;re still brainstorming.</p>
<p>Below are some screenshots of the work we did in VEX. I have to say that we were highly inspired from the archery game in The Lab, most of us are really big fans of that game right now!</p>

He is an innovative educator, being recognized as the <a href="https://www.iste.org/getinvolved/recognize-excellence/awards/award-detail?AwardTypeID=6" target="_blank">Outstanding Teacher of the Year by ISTE</a>, among many other honors.</p>
<p>Foundry10 first began working with Steve on studying the impacts of game design, but have been supporting virtual reality in his classroom for a few years.  His unique setup and has helped us learn great amounts about the potential of VR for learning, and we wanted to share his story, experiences with the technology, and advice for others who are looking to get started.  The following is our interview with Steve.  Below the interview, check out the video testimonials of parents, teachers and students who have tried VR with Steve!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><i>F10: Please give us a little background on the types of classes you offer and the technology you are using.</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> I teach Game Design and Digital Storytelling (7th grade cycle – 6 week course that all 7th graders take) and Game Design and Development (8th grade elective – full semester). Currently, we have the Oculus Rift, SDK1 and the Comercial HTC Vive, and I hope to add the Playstation VR and other technologies as well.</p>
<p><i>F10: Do you have different goals for each of those classes?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> The seventh grade cycle course is an exploratory course so I aim to introduce students to the game design process with a strong emphasis on narrative and storytelling in games.</p>
<p>The 8th grade course goes into more depth with coding, graphic design, sound engineering, etc. The aim there is to develop game design teams to create original games regardless of the platform / game engine the students choose to use. It is a choice / quest based course so students have opportunities to expand their learning based on a variety of learning pathways. This could include research on VR, game reviews (VR and non-VR), working on passion projects, coding, and much more.</p>
<p><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steve-in-vive-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1424" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steve-in-vive-300x200.jpg 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steve-in-vive-768x512.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steve-in-vive-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steve-in-vive-30x20.jpg 30w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steve-in-vive-1170x780.jpg 1170w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steve-in-vive.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><i>F10: What are your larger philosphical goals or vision for VR in education?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> My goal is to provide students with opportunities to create content in VR. I believe we are putting this technology in our students’ hands so early in the development process that they have a unique opportunity to learn with the rise and get quite a head start. What an amazing opportunity for career readiness and empowerment!</p>
<p><i>F10: Do you think your students have individual goals for themselves in regards to VR?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> Great question. I believe that once they see what’s possible and choose to take on what’s next (i.e. content development) then yes. Some get to that point, others don’t and that is a natural part of my choice based learning environment.</p>
<p><i>F10: We’ve seen different approaches to scaffolding in VR, do you have any methods for introducing VR to your students?</i></p>
<p><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vive-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1428" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vive-225x300.jpg 225w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vive.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/student-using-vive-23x30.jpg 23w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> As a new technology, I feel that exploration continues to be an important first step. I like to provide students with many opportunities to explore existing content and get a sense of what is possible. After that, we tend to move to software that allows for creation within VR (titles like <a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/" target="_blank">Tilt Brush</a>, <a href="http://www.3dsunshine.com/" target="_blank">3dSunshine</a>, <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/vr/" target="_blank">minecraft / vivecraft</a>, etc.) where the students are creating with the existing tools within the software. The final frontier would be to learn to use software that can allow students to create original content that could become VR experiences (i.e. <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity3d</a>, <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/414120/" target="_blank">ModBox</a>)</p>
<p><i>F10: You have some open-ended opportunities that allow students to invest time pending their interest, how do you think that has been working with VR?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> This is a great question. I am a firm believer of providing students with choice and allowing passion to drive the process. It makes me question whether content creation in VR is a big leap for students of the age that I work with or not. When it comes to playing VR games to review them, kids love to dive in and contribute that type of content. I believe it will be a much smaller group that go head first into content creation on a deeper level. I would like to see the course be offered at the high school where I think it would be more natural to bring in tools like Unity as part of the foundation. </p>
<p><i>F10: What are the benefits and/or drawbacks of this process for students working with VR?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> The benefit is that students are truly choosing to learn and that intrinsic motivation is a huge driving force. The drawback is that students are being asked to take true ownership of the learning so they need to pursue the learning with far less support / guidance / direct instruction. Moving forward I could see where providing demo lessons to everyone will increase student participation as they all at least learn the basics of some of the tools in a more structured environment.</p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steves-classroom-1.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steves-classroom-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1427" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steves-classroom-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steves-classroom-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steves-classroom-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steves-classroom-1-30x23.jpg 30w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/steves-classroom-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><i>F10: Space is one of the biggest challenges in using VR in classrooms.  Can you detail how you’ve organized the room and your thinking behind this use of space?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> A big focus of mine over the past few years has been to create the ultimate learning space with tons of resources for kids, mounted TVs around the room, and comfortable seating areas. I wanted to create a special place for my students, somewhat akin to a startup or studio environment. Fortunately, perhaps somewhat by accident, I chose yogibo bean bag furniture for the sitting areas. Each sitting area (one in the front and one in the back of the room) have a nice rectangular shag carpet to put the bean bag furniture on. The carpet turned out to be a perfect space to define for the HTC Vive. It’s also lucky that the bean bag furniture is so easy to move that within about a minute I can remove it all to clear the space and put it all back to recreate the living room feel. Finally, it makes for a pretty reasonable rule that when someone is using the Vive everyone else should be off the carpet.  Somehow we’ve defined this great space for the room scale experience!</p>
<p><i>F10: How would you improve on your layout?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> In time I would like to create more open space which is challenging in a computer lab. I would like to see more versatile workspace including some tables with laptops to allow for more versatility in general. Perhaps that would also help with the Oculus Rift and eventually the PSVR.</p>
<p><i>F10: What are some of your favorite pieces of content for use in the classroom? Why?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> <a href="http://jobsimulatorgame.com/" target="blank">Job Simulator</a> – such an easy point of entry. Everyone loves it. It gives the experience of the simplicity of working with the Vive controllers in VR.</p>
<p><a href="http://waterbearsgame.com/" target="blank">Water Bears</a>&#8211; GREAT game that really feels intuitive in terms of the vive and the controllers – you really feel immersed in the game experience – and it’s a fun, cute game!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.3dsunshine.com/" target="blank">3dsunshine</a> – perhaps my favorite so far – 3dsunshine allows you to build using minecraft blocks with the vive in such an intuitive manner. Sure seems more logical than using a mouse or worse yet a touch screen on the pocket edition. The game provides an opportunity to free build or to load an existing minecraft world and build and save right to the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/451520/" target="blank">theBlu</a> – Great for the immersive VR experience – not so interactive, but great for exploration and the Wow factor!</p>
<p><a href="https://virzoom.com/" target="blank">virZoom</a> – we purchased a virzoom bike for our classroom and the ability to ride the bike and control the different games in the virZoom arcade is awesome. Feels so real that kids often say they are afraid they will fall off the bike. There are a variety of fun games to play and the idea of exercising while in VR is revolutionary. The SDK is also provided so it is my hope that in time kids will create their own minigames or experiences that integrate the bike.</p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/322770/" target="blank">Vanishing Realms</a> – I haven’t personally played, but I have a student who has clocked hours in the game and gets completely immersed when playing – seems like a great proof of concept for full on RPG / hack and slash games in VR></p>
<p><i>F10: Now that you&#8217;re in your second year, is there anything that you still find challenging with VR?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> It can sometimes be a challenge to get both the Vive in use and the Oculus at the same time as they technically use the same Steam account so there can be conflicts there. Not a big deal, but I find we focus on the Vive (maybe because the Oculus with the SDK can be finicky with connecting to certain software). Also still trying to overcome the hump of truly getting kids involved in content creation but now that there is more software that allows you to create right in VR I think we will move further in that direction.</p>

<p><i>F10: Looking forward, is there anything that you&#8217;d like to develop more in your curriculum or with your students? Anything else you’d like them to be exposed to?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> As I mentioned previously, I think more direct instruction or experiences with professionals demo-ing products for the students to get them started would be great. </p>
<p><i>F10: Do you have any final pieces of advice for other educators or students that are looking to get involved in VR?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> DIVE in. Create a culture in class where students understand that they will all get a chance. Once students start to see that they can continue working on other projects without being distracted because when they get a turn they will get a full experience. Don’t try to limit experiences to 2 – 5 minutes to get everyone in. It’s much better to allow students to have an authentic experience. </p>
<p><i>F10: And to end it all, how can people find you, Steve?</i></p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> The best way is via Twitter, I am <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_isaacs" target="_blank">@mr_isaacs</a>.  You can follow my blog: <a href="http://gamesandlearning1.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Games and Learning</a>.  And, you can email me at stevei2071@gmail.com.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research has suggested that exposure to new and emerging technology is very beneficial to teachers in training.  Being able to see what is coming up and consider how it might make an impact in classrooms brings new perspectives and ideas.  So, when we met Mark Stevens of Bowling Greene State University in Ohio, we were intrigued to hear that he works with pre-service teachers and wanted to bring VR to his students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout late 2016, we connected with Mark to develop a plan on how to introduce VR in an educational setting to future teachers.  We are interested in answering a few key questions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of opportunities do they imagine for using VR with students?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do they have different ideas than in-service teachers?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does exposure to VR change their perceptions of technology in general?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students in BGSU’s education program will be developing lesson plans using VR, considering uses for it with students outside of lessons, and working with the technology center at the school to prototype VR content for use in education.  Throughout the course, we will be surveying the students, interviewing the instructor, and administering a few different measures all to better understand the way these students see technology, and particularly VR, fitting into their teaching practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned for more information!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VR Partner Schools program is the less formal branch of our exploration of VR and its uses in classrooms.  Many of the methods and practices are the same as what we use in our more formal study, however we are more flexible with timing and proposals in this program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideas that we have supported range from a student VR developer group at a school in Portugal to studying its uses with pre-service teachers in Ohio.  We can be very broad with this program, and it is our goal to enable students, educators, and communities to make their exciting ideas a reality and share the knowledge gained with the world.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in being a part of this program, please &lt;a href=”..contact-us”&gt;reach out to us&lt;/a&gt;!  In your email, please include the following things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A description of your idea for using VR in an educational setting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school or organization you are associated with (we do not give VR kits just to individuals)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline you are looking at for getting your idea up and running</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little bit about yourself and your interest in VR</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions, please let us know.  We look forward to hearing your ideas!</span></p>
