>The Nova Project</a> and <a href="https://www.seattlegirlsschool.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Girl&#8217;s School</a>.  We were interested in how exposure to our student-led robotics program improved student confidence with technology, productive risk-taking, and the perception of robotics as a community exercise.  We used a combination of likert-type scale survey questions and open-ended questions.  We found some gains in these areas, but hope to expand our sample size to improve our understanding of the impact that this experience has on students.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Shoreline Kindergarten Readiness Program Report</h2>
<p>In Summer 2016, foundry10 collaborated with Shoreline School District to support a month-long kindergarten readiness program. Students coming in to kindergarten have a wide range of skill sets, with some students more prepared for the demands of kindergarten than others. To close the readiness gap, Shoreline approached us with the idea to design a summer class with the express purpose of preparing students for their first year in kindergarten. We decided to focus on boosting skills at this age, because of evidence that early intervention is particularly beneficial in closing achievement gaps. Elementary schools throughout the district identified students who were enrolled in kindergarten but hadnâ€™t previously had preschool, and invited a small number of these students to participate. One class of seven students participated in July before starting kindergarten the following month. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Dramatic Storytelling and Literacy</h1>
<p>This article describes a method of exploring and expanding literacy using dramatic storytelling techniques.  In this program, we paired drama teaching artists with teachers to engage young students in literacy-based exercises in a unique and fun way.  You can download the report here: <a href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dramatic-storytelling.pdf">Dramatic Storytelling and Literacy</a></p>
<p><b>Excerpt</b>: <i>We define dramatic storytelling as a collective, shared, collaborative storytelling with a connection to a real book. In our examples, the appropriate age range for this style of dramatic storytelling is traditionally suitable for ages three to seven. For our design, we utilized local dramatic teaching artists to come in and work alongside teachers in classrooms. Our goal was to have classroom teachers able to lead the exercises, in their regular classrooms, largely unassisted by the teaching artists, by the end of the program. In our model of dramatic storytelling, the primary storyteller, the teaching artist or adult, has the trajectory of the story arc based on an actual text, but the details are created by the children through a shared storytelling experience. Research suggests that reading and storytelling have a complementary relationship with one another with regard to language development and story comprehension; the two methods offer different benefits and combined with one another, provide an additive effect on overall reading development . (Isbell et al., 2004). Therefore, as a fusion of reading and storytelling, dramatic storytelling is likely able to strengthen both sets of skills.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Abstract</i></p>
<p>The popularity of multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games provides an opportunity to examine how cognitive skills are linked with changes in player performance within a team-based game genre. There is evidence that video game experience in other genres is connected with specific cognitive skills such as visuospatial attention and working memory capacity. Links have also been observed outside of video games such as numerical intelligence being correlated with the performance of chess experts. In the present study, we investigated whether numerical and working memory ability measured at an initial time-point predicted changes in MOBA skill and gameplay frequency measured five months later. We observed that participants who scored higher on a number processing task had greater improvements in MOBA skill and that this link depended on the social context of the gameplay. Specifically, numerical skill was linked to player rankings generated from matches where they were paired with random individuals; no connection was observed with gameplay that took place with a familiar set of teammates. The results of the present study extend previous research indicating video gameplay is linked to specific cognitive skills, in the case of MOBAs being numerical processing. We suggest that the difference in the connection with number ability to gameplay with novel and familiar players is in line with evidence that the importance of individual performance and the sense of achievement can be reduced in team settings. We suggest that future research should examine what types of quantitative abilities are indicative of MOBA skill and the impact of those factors relative to social skills.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the spring of 2016, foundry10 teamed up with Shoreline School District to provide a week-long math and reading program that had an integrated drama component with the goal of enhancing student skills and motivation. Shoreline Schools Foundation and foundry10 partnered to create an original program at Parkwood Elementary School Spring Break 2016 where we joined creative/dramatic arts with traditional CORE curriculum for 5-days over Spring Break. Students testing at the cusp of being able to pass the SBAC in April were invited to the week-long intervention. Four teachers were recruited for the program that targeted 3rd through 6th grade students. From April 18-22, foundry10 instructors provided classroom instruction, including 20 hours of integrated and direct instruction with drama to explore the content and structure of stories. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 2015-2016 school year, foundry10 put VR in the classrooms of 390 students in the US and Canada.  Our objective was to collaborate with teachers to find out more about what really happens when VR enters the classroom.  Through a series of surveys and interviews, we gathered data at the beginning, middle and end of the program in each school.  The teachers used the technology in the way that made sense for them and their students, and as a result we were granted a view at a wide variety of different ideas for how VR can enhance classroom learning.</p>
<p>Below are our initial reports,the dataset that includes the anonymized survey responses from the students in the program, and a brief description of the program itself.  Please take a look and <a href="../contact-us/">reach out to us</a> if you have any thoughts or questions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Excerpt:</i></p>
<p>Exploring technology is a vital part of modern day studentsâ€™ educational experiences. Often, however, schools come in on the tail-end of an emerging technology, thereby limiting studentsâ€™ opportunities for exposure and skill development. Advanced technology can be considered a type of cultural capital which students can utilize in order to progress and navigate future career pathways. Virtual reality is one such advanced technology, now readily commercially available, which is making its way into classrooms. Our recent research focusing on the implementation of VR in classrooms provides information about how educators can make VR accessible to students. Access in virtually reality can be considered through multiple lenses and we discuss a few of them here. The first considers learning styles and nontraditional engagement, the second discusses access to a global education, and the third revolves around issues of social justice. We feel these areas are highly relevant considerations for educators as they consider the use of virtual reality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Excerpt:</i><br />
Virtual reality is starting to make its way into classrooms across the country. Although the VR content itself is engaging and interesting in its own right, VR has much more potential for learning. Our work with students in seven different schools last year showed us that it is not just content consumption and gaming that kids are thinking about when they consider VR. Though students definitely told us how much they liked being on a shipwrecked boat deep under the sea, or trying to communicate with one another as they solved a challenging puzzle while immersed in a different world, we were intrigued by the number of students who really engaged with VR in a much broader sense. Whether it was as artistic visionaries creating 3D art pieces, working in VR game engines to design content, creating 360 videos for other students to watch, or even exploring the functionality of VR itself, there was a great deal of learning going on. In fact, virtual reality seemed to tap into student interest in computer science in new ways. As this technology becomes more accessible to schools, weâ€™d like educators to consider the breadth of learning that can occur within VR.</p>
