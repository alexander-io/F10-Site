				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This report covers what we have learned over the past 3 years running digital audio programs in schools, with community partners, and on our own.</p>
<p>We have been running digital audio programs since 2014, and have explored many different ways of offering and structuring the courses. While there is still so much to learn about the subject, the audio team at foundry10 has put together a report showcasing the work they have done and what they have learned about how high school students interact with digital audio. Please read the report below if you want to find out more about our audio program, its history, and what we have learned so far.</p>
<p><a href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Audio-Overview-2016.pdf">Read the report</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of our early education program, we partnered with Shoreline Children&#8217;s Center to try using story drama, the act of collaboratively creating stories in a group environment. Afterword, we surveyed the students and talked to the teachers to find out more about what they learned, what they thought of using story drama, and the impact it had on their class and students. This information was presented as part of an internal data-sharing event foundry10 holds each quarter called Data-Bytes.  Check out the slides below!</p>
<p>This data is from a 6-8 week residency using dramatic storytelling from two consecutive years.  The teaching arists in 2015 and 2016 were Chelsea LeValley and Amy Jurkieweiz, respectively.</p>
