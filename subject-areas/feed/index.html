<p>In 2017, for the second year in a row, we combined our love of learning and cars to design an out-of-state educational field trip for local automotive students and their instructors. Last year, we took five students to <a href="http://www.mazdaraceway.com/" target="_blank">Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca</a> and <a href="http://canepa.com" target="_blank">Canepa</a> to watch and interact with professional IMSA race teams and learn about automotive history and restoration. This year, our data from students showed that they would be most interested in attending an event in the Formula Drift series. So, we set out to create an interesting, valuable, and exciting learning experience for local students and believe we succeeded in just that.</p>
<p>So, why take students to a race?</p>
<p>As an organization, we focus on the value of having novices intersect with experts in learning environments. Through partnerships with local high school automotive programs, we have been investigating the best ways to provide these types of interactions for the benefit of students. Upon hearing that students were interested in <a href="http://www.formulad.com/" target="_blank">Formula Drift</a>, we reached out to Jim Liaw, the President of the organization. We explained that we wanted to bring a group of high school students and their teachers on a plane from Seattle to Long Beach so they could attend The Streets of Long Beach competition and expand their understanding of careers in the performance automotive industry. In addition to the races themselves, we wanted to provide opportunities for the students to connect with a variety of professionals and different automobiles during their visit. Jim hopped right on the phone with us to talk about what he could do to assist. We also reached out to the <a href="https://petersen.org/" target="_blank">Petersen Auto Museum</a> in Los Angeles to arrange for a tour of “The Vault” which contains some of the world’s most rare cars.</p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Group-with-Jim-2.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Group-with-Jim-2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1561" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Group-with-Jim-2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Group-with-Jim-2-768x576.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Group-with-Jim-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Group-with-Jim-2-30x23.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Students who were interested in attending the trip wrote us an essay about their interest in automotive technology and ideas for future career paths. All students who submitted essays were then invited to an interview where we asked them to talk about their experiences with cars, what they found most intriguing, from a learning perspective, about attending the race in Long Beach, and what they hoped to gain from this experience. It was very difficult to choose the students because we heard some incredibly compelling and interesting stories about how automotive classes impacted their lives and how they hoped to use this experience to help them think about their career paths within automotive fields. We ultimately selected 10 students (three of which were outstanding female students) and also brought their teachers, Pat McCue out of the Northshore Automotive Program and Richie del Puerto out of the Sno-Isle Tech Center.</p>
<p>This was our first time taking students to a drift event and we were not disappointed! Jim Liaw personally took our group around the morning we arrived at the track. The students told us in advance they were particularly interested in tires and how they influence the cars during drifting. An expert from Nexen Tires spent time with the students and teachers and explained the unique challenges that tires pose when drifting. From there, students spoke with Rusty Waples, the Brand Manager for Black Magic and Gumout through ITW Global Brands who discussed the technical challenges of engines in drift cars as well as some of the marketing and business issues people involved in the sport need to consider. Students then had a chance to speak briefly with well-known drift racer, Ken Gushi, and see his Toyota 86 car up-close. Throughout the course of the weekend students would get to experience the spotters’ tent, talk at length with an electronics technician from AEM about electronic control units, meet with another driver, Alec Hohnadell, and speak with a lead mechanic from the Hoonigan team. These opportunities to intersect with the professionals and speak with them about their career paths, education, and day to day challenges were among the most impactful parts of the weekend. We were incredibly impressed with the open, communicative nature of the professionals at the race. Their willingness to engage with students and openly share knowledge was really a fantastic part of the trip.</p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Beau-AEM-1.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Beau-AEM-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1562" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Beau-AEM-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Beau-AEM-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Beau-AEM-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Beau-AEM-1-30x23.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Having the teachers present is another key component of the automotive trip experiences. The teachers are able to make connections back to the classroom and auto-shop which helps make the learning more explicit. They are able to draw students’ attention to particular aspects of the performance racing scene that are relevant to the work students do in their shops (or on their pit crews, in the case of the Northshore program). Even when we were looking at the various show cars and race cars, the students and teachers were having technical conversations about the tuning done to individual cars.</p>
<p>We wrapped up the weekend at the Petersen Auto Museum. We learned last year that getting an up-close look at a wide variety of cars with experts available to discuss and answer questions was a real added bonus. Drift cars obviously encompass a very finite, particular range of vehicles for students to explore. The Petersen Museum is world-renowned for its collection ranging from some of the first cars ever built to incredibly cutting edge super-cars. Students engaged in lively discussions with their peers and teachers about the cars, builds and modifications we saw at the museum as well. It gave them the chance to see a wide array of cars as well as informative displays, such as the Maserati section which featured pulled apart Quattroporte’s so that students could explore the suspension, engines, frame and body as separate components. </p>
<p>The experience culminated in follow-up research interviews with students and teachers honing in on what was most valuable in terms of their own learning and development so that we can use those findings to drive future automotive projects. We at foundry10 were just thrilled with the second iteration of the automotive racing trip model. We are grateful for the time, support and collaboration of the folks at Formula Drift, the input and work of both teachers, and for the enthusiasm and willingness to learn and experience new things the students brought. We look forward to sharing a recap video as well as findings from our research questions in early May!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>New Musical Update</h2>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nmp-1.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nmp-1-480x375.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="375" class="alignleft size-cherry-thumb-s wp-image-1555" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nmp-1-480x375.jpg 480w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nmp-1-30x23.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>Large-scale collaboration in writing is a rarity for stage musicals. Often the collaboration model for writers of a new musical includes two adults: a composer and a book writer. </p>
<p>We decided to shake it up and include adult mentors alongside students and encouraged role swaps like composers helping with book writing and book writers to writing songs.</p>
<p>The foundry10 new musical, currently titled 78 minutes, is being written by a team of students, teaching artists, and foundry10 staff. It’s a story of what happens to society in the wake of a supernova.</p>
<p>The team started writing in summer 2016 and have continued to work throughout the year, including events like a table reading of the full musical with a group of young actors.</p>
<p>Here are some reflections from team-member Autumn after having twenty actors join the team to read their words aloud and listen to the team sing the songs in context of the full musical: </p>
<p><i><center>Writing a musical can seem like a ridiculously large challenge. And let me tell you, it is. But there is also something extremely rewarding listening to actors read your lines and lyrics that have come out of your head. Hearing someone else read your work can also help you understand it better. What worked and what doesn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Hearing the feedback from a completely unbiased party is also very eye opening. I honestly think that the reading with actors was the best thing we had done for the project so far. It helped us understand our work as a whole. It also helped us understand what needed to be done and gave us new goal to work towards. It made everything feel a little less overwhelming and just as overwhelming at the same time. Now that we have worked on the project for a couple more months after the reading I hope we can try for another table reading followed by a full staged reading. I also think we need to join together as a group again and redefine, clarify, and re-establish the purpose is of telling our story. I can&#8217;t wait to get back to work on the musical, and start sharing it with more people! </center></i></p>
<p>The team is planning to do the staged reading with a group of actors singing and performing the musical at a local theater in Seattle this summer. Stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bringing Social Justice Theater to Schools</h2>
<p>At foundry10, we are interested in exploring how students connect to themes of social justice and believe providing a social medium like theater arts may empower student voice in these areas. Below are descriptions of the Social Justice Theater programs we conducted in the 2016-2017 school year, followed by some reflections by a teaching artist involved in the program.<br />

<b>Social Justice Theater at Kenmore Junior High School</b></p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kenmore-1.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kenmore-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-1548" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kenmore-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kenmore-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kenmore-1-768x432.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kenmore-1-30x17.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /></a></p>
<p><i>Two hundred students, two teachers, two teaching artists, and a month long, collaboratively designed curriculum using theater arts to explore issues related to social justice.</i></p>
<p>Teacher Jeanne Medalia at Kenmore Junior High and Chelsea, foundry10 dramatic arts program developer, discovered a common interest in advocacy in social justice and theater arts through conversations during a professional development course for teachers and artists called <a href="https://www.sct.org/For-Educators/TAT-Lab/" target="_blank">TAT LAB</a>. Partnering with Jeanne’s colleague, Jolene Conklin, as well as two other teaching artists, Meredith Berlin and Keni Cohen, foundry10 developed an idea for a month-long collaboration on social justice theater in every ninth grade English classroom at Kenmore Junior High School, in winter 2017. The teachers and teaching artists worked together to generate curriculum to create a framework for students to build awareness and take action to openly discuss and reflect upon issues of social justice and advocacy in the world they live in today. The month long intervention was designed to also prepare students to dive deeper into the social justice issues inherent in their upcoming unit on <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i>. The goal was for students to reflect on the issues in small group,s respond to it through creating pieces of theater, and ultimately sharing with another class to facilitate a large group discussion. Not only did the students learn, but the teachers expressed that they really grew in their confidence to teach using theater arts in the classroom.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;<br />
<b>Social Justice Theater at NOVA High School</b><br />
NOVA High school English teacher, Brian, expressed interest in having a foundry10 teaching artist use some artistic approaches to helping the students connect and engage with the literature they were tackling in the winter/spring. His selection of graphic novels in winter and spring quarter, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Born-Chinese-Gene-Luen/dp/0312384483" target="_blank">American Born Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/March-Book-One-John-Lewis/dp/1603093001" target="_blank">March</a>, are ripe with relevant social justice issues. Foundry10 teaching artist, dancer, and theater generator Cessa Betancourt, used movement and artistic expression to engage students with the material. She and Brian worked out a collaboration where she came in every other Friday during their unit to lead an engaged reflection exercise on the current material they were covering in the book. The first time she came, the students drew a work of art together in response to their processing of the book’s content. Then, they added movement to and music and generated a moment of theatrical response to the material with their bodies in space at the end of each class session. She is continuing to work with Brian this spring on a new graphic novel, March. Their collaboration is a great example of teachers and teaching artists working together on process-driven curriculum.</p>
<p>In another classroom at NOVA, Cessa teamed up with teachers, Chelsey and Melissa, to add a devised theater element to their spoken word class, Naked Truth. Chelsey and Melissa have experience teaching social justice theater arts in relationship to spoken word but this year they were interested in bringing more movement and group work to the class project. Cessa, with her background in movement and refugee work, was a natural fit for guiding the class through this additional element of the class work. Cessa used movement and devised theater practices to guide the students in exploring their spoken word pieces, ultimately tying them together into performance they will share at the end of the school year at an assembly and with their community in the evening. Of the program, Cessa said, <i>“It’s really exciting to work with such smart kids who are able to engage in discussion about the power of using art as a device for social change.”</i><br />

<b>Social Justice Theater at Mercer Island High School</b><br />
<a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sjt-mercer-island.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sjt-mercer-island.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1547" /></a>Theater arts teacher, Daniella, at Mercer Island High School teamed up with foundry10 teaching artist and new works developer, Zoe Wilson, to dive deep into a three week social justice theater arts intervention in their classroom. Zoe, alongside Daniella, used techniques from Augusto Boal’s Theater of the Oppressed body of work, as well as devised theater practices to facilitate the students’ experience generating moments of theater that highlight issues of social justice relevant to their everyday lives. The students performed their pieces in front of peers and community members on Monday, May 12th, in the evening. </p>

<b>Social Justice Theater at Nathan Hale High School</b></p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sjt-nathan-hale.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sjt-nathan-hale.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1546" /></a></p>
<p>Eleventh grade English teachers Kristina and Sarah, at Nathan Hale High School, did a unit where all five eleventh grade classes wrote, recorded, and produced a podcast. They teamed up with foundry10 to steer the students’ storytelling toward issues related to social justice. Playwright, actor, voice-over artist, director and foundry10 teaching artist James Sasser joined their classrooms to guide the students in idea generation as they identified issues of justice within given plays, script writing, and performance skills in preparation for their final podcasts. We were interested in the way students brought vulnerability and openness as they processed social justice issues through developing stories within the context of a small group dynamic, and ultimately shared their creative work as a podcast with a larger audience. Their program runs through May 2017. We look forward to their reflections near the end of the school year.</p>

<b>Teaching artist reflections &#8211; Kenmore:</b></p>
<p><b>F10:</b> What was the focus of the social justice program you did with your teacher?</p>
<p><i>Our focus was to give students an opportunity to use dramatic techniques to explore social justice issues that are important to them in the present, in preparation for their study of To Kill a Mockingbird and civil rights issues in the United States.  The process involved building trust, learning to work as an ensemble, identifying issues of importance, and learning movement and acting techniques to create a piece to perform to their peers in other classes.</i></p>
<p><b>F10:</b> What were things you wanted to learn from it?</p>
<p><i>Which techniques would the students be excited by?  How much trust could be established in just a month?  How would the students deal with the need to collaborate and compromise?  Could we reach consensus on which issues were important?  What kinds of emotions would the process trigger? How much would the students be willing to share?  Which techniques would be simple yet dynamic as we created a performance piece?</i></p>
<p><b>F10:</b> How did you approach the curriculum? What was the typical class or process like for the students/teacher?</p>
<p><i>We generated pages and pages of ideas of activities we could do with the students, materials we could bring in, music we could use.  We planned the first session together in detail, then waited to meet the students and get their responses before planning the rest of the curriculum in detail.  We did, however, decide that there would be a mix of physical work, individual writing, sharing with a partner, working in small groups and large group discussions and presentation.  After the first week, it became clear to us which of the many ideas we had could work together.  But each day there was some degree of changing and adjusting our plans based on the ideas of the students, their energy coming into class, and their needs from moment to moment.</i></p>
<p><b>F10:</b> What are some things you remember the students saying?</p>
<p><i>One thing that stands out in my memory were the several times that we introduced a difficult topic, and there would be silence.  If we asked them to discuss with somebody nearby then share what they heard or agreed on, that would open the discussion and others would be willing to jump in.  I also noticed that the students were much more willing to tackle uncomfortable issues as characters, or when discussing choices characters made.</i></p>
<p>Often the students remarked that within one class, people could have opposed views and still respect each other.  Or have opposite experiences.  For example, we were discussing places we felt safe.  We started out by anonymously writing on two papers a place we felt comfortable or safe, and one we felt uncomfortable or unsafe.  Then we crumpled them up, threw them in the middle, and read a random one we picked up.  Many students named their rooms, or their homes on the &#8220;safe&#8221; paper, but a few put it on the &#8220;unsafe&#8221; paper.  That was something that made the students think, and they dealt with it with maturity and seriousness.  We also talked about potentially divisive issues such as sexism, racism, zenophobia, homophobia.  By that point, the students had had the experience of listening deeply and respectfully to each other, and I was very impressed that they were willing to grapple with these issues without attacking each other.</p>
<p><b>F10:</b> What is something you took away from the program/experience?</p>
<p><i>Ninth graders notice, know and experience way more than they usually have the opportunity to reveal.  They are hungry to learn from each other and, when they know they are safe to be honest, they are extremely expressive and capable of making connections that are complex and creating art that is surprising and compelling.  They have many questions that I do not know how to answer, questions that need to be asked.</i></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes: Commercial VR Content for Learning?

<p>One of the most interesting elements of virtual reality for learning is that provides a real opportunity for educators to redefine what it means to explore and learn from content. VR does more than just present information like a moving diagram or tell a story like a film, it presents a chance to fundamentally interact with ideas and information in new ways. This type of interaction is a really useful thing for schools to think about and consider.</p>
<p>Kids have repeatedly told us that they fear that when VR crosses over into education, school will ruin it. It will become another form of virtual textbook; a more narrow, watered down version of the potential they see in commercial content and on their favorite Youtube channels. We don’t think that is necessarily the case, but we can see where they are coming from, and are big advocates for thinking creatively about how to use VR to illustrate concepts and expand students’ thinking about learning in general.</p>
<p>In some cases, that requires fundamentally rethinking what “educational content” might look like.  We might be inclined to use something like “Public Speaking Simulator” to build communication skills, which is great.  At the same time it may behoove us, as educators, to think more broadly about the idea of communication skills and consider something a bit less traditional, like, in this case, defusing a bomb.</p>
<p>To illustrate this concept, we are going to focus on one extremely versatile piece of content that is not explicitly educational that we have seen several educators use in interesting ways: Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (KTANE for short). The general gist of KTANE is that one person, or student in this case, is wearing a VR headset and they see some type of bomb that needs disarming. The bomb’s timer is counting down and the student clearly sees that buttons need to be pressed, wires cut, etc. in order to make the counter stop. However, the student in the headset is missing a critical piece of information: they have absolutely no idea how to disarm the bomb. The people who do know how to disarm the bomb are, fortunately, nearby. A few other students have a physical handbook (available online to print) that shows a variety of different bomb types, parts and the directions on how to identify and ultimately disarm them. The trick is that the students with the handbook each only have certain pages, cannot see the bomb themselves, and the student that can see the bomb cannot see the handbook. Thus, clear communication is needed, and fast.</p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane_gameplay_2.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane_gameplay_2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1542" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane_gameplay_2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane_gameplay_2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane_gameplay_2-768x432.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane_gameplay_2-30x17.jpg 30w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane_gameplay_2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, let’s pause here for a second. Unless one is in advanced military or law enforcement training, bomb defusal is not really a necessary skill-set. How does this intersect with traditional school? Our research with teachers has shown that there are actually many situations that it can intersect with traditional school in interesting, engaging, and lively ways and help kids tap into several useful educational skills.</p>
<p>For instance, we had a language arts teacher use the program with students who were struggling with clear, verbal communication. Though her curriculum did not include bomb defusal, it did include interactions with peers, conversations about key concepts that need to be communicated and clear articulation of one’s ideas. Her students found it thrilling to practice these skills in an environment where time and clear communication were of the essence. They were able to extrapolate ideas from the virtual interactions into other areas of their class where similar types of communication were needed.</p>
<p>An English language teacher at the high school level was working with a remedial English class on writing and communicating instructions. The students were already working on a project where they would be writing step-by-step instructions for other students to follow. KTANE provided a concrete example of a manual used for instructional purposes. The students participated in the virtual experience, analyzed how the instruction manual was laid out and used that as the starting point for their own projects.</p>
<p>We had a leadership teacher who used the game as a team-building tool. Students discussed what it meant to cooperate on a team, not yell out all at once, delegate responsibilities and to be a functional, collaborative group. By sharing and debriefing the experience, students were able to reflect on what it meant to work effectively as a team.</p>
<p>A foreign language teacher adapted the same piece of content but used it as a translation and speech exercise. Advanced foreign language students modified the “handbook” into French to communicate with a student who was in the headset, describing the bomb, also in French. Using VR for foreign language, with the goal of having students communicate effectively in the target language, is an interesting way to look at language fluency, particularly in advanced classes with time-pressure added.</p>
<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane-manual.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane-manual-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1543" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane-manual-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane-manual-300x169.jpg 300w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane-manual-768x432.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ktane-manual-30x17.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>Each of these teachers found a way to integrate the commercial content into their classroom curriculum in ways that were interesting, entertaining, valuable and relevant. Whether it was verbal communication (in English or a target language), collaborative group skills, writing, or analyzing and debriefing what worked effectively (or not), a host of opportunities were present for students to engage in thinking and learning in a virtual environment, with content that is well-designed and clever.</p>
<p>Often when we talk with teachers, they ask us to find highly specific content that they can use for a particular course or unit. And, at times, that is what is called for or needed. However, we also encourage educators to consider opportunities to include content that really does provide students with something different, something they likely couldn’t experience anywhere but virtually, and how those may naturally fit within their curriculum. </p>
<p>Students tell us they won’t soon forget their virtual bomb defusal nor the skills they developed as a result. Virtual reality is a different way to experience the world and thus, as educators, we need to reflect on how we might best capitalize on those experiences and use them to enhance our students’ thinking, communication and reasoning skills. Learning in VR does not have to look the same as learning in the traditional classroom.</p>
<p><i>*foundry10 has no connection to the creators of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, we really just think highly of their VR experience and want to share and inspire other educators to think creatively.</i></p>

On a recent trip to Toronto we had the pleasure of talking with Jim Wardle about a lesson he developed with an instructor named Jordan Young for an Intro to Trigonometry class at Westside Secondary School.</p>
<p>What made the teachers excited about the lesson was that it put kids in real-life situations, included elevation and depression angles and included opportunities to discuss sources of error. In particular, the students discussed how the math could be right but one can still get an incorrect answer.</p>
<p>A suggestion the teachers had after doing the lesson was that perhaps using an outstretched hand with the Vive controller pointing to the top of the building and putting the clinometer on the person’s arm might provide a more accurate measurement. When they ran the lesson the first time, they either used it against where the person was looking or the Vive controller at the person’s face, which may have accounted for increased errors.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank Jim and Jordan for sharing their lesson, invite you to <a href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/YoungJordan-MBF3C-VRClinometerAssignment-1-1.pdf">download the lesson</a> and would love to hear <a href="../contact-us/" target="_blank">feedback or suggestions</a> if you try it out!</p>

<p>Foundry10 is currently in the process of recruiting educators and schools for our 2017-2018 virtual reality study. This will be our third in-school study and we are excited to move ahead and learn more from students and teachers about technology in the classroom.</p>
<p>Our first study, in the 2015-2016 school year focused on the implementation and management of various types of VR hardware in the classroom and included seven schools in the United States and Canada. Our findings, data and suggestions from that study can all be found on our website under Virtual Reality in both the programs and research tabs.</p>
<p>This school year, 2016-2017 we are gathering the final round of student data at this time. This study involved 19 schools in the U.S. and Canada and the focus was on immersion, perspective, and the general value that VR creates in an educational setting both for content consumers of VR and content creators. Data from this study will be available mid-summer. </p>
<p>For the upcoming, 2017-2018 school year our research questions are informed by the student responses and comments from the second year of the study. We will be focusing both on VR and technology use more generally. We will examine student interest in technology, the access routes they utilize to engage with technology, their use of VR as an emerging technology and we will focus on subject-specific areas of VR integration (art, foreign language, social studies/language arts, tech classes and science/math). The questions this coming year are more refined and again based on the perceived value of an emerging technology to both students and teachers in the classroom. As always, we do not dictate the hardware selected by the teacher, but we will provide VR hardware to new schools joining the study as well as a stipend for content. Returning schools will receive an additional content stipend. Teachers select all of their own content to ensure that it is a good match for their curriculum and course objectives.</p>
<p><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/student-vive-4-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="450" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-1529" srcset="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/student-vive-4.jpg 768w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/student-vive-4-225x300.jpg 225w, http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/student-vive-4-23x30.jpg 23w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /></a></p>
<p>Our study design will remain nearly consistent to the previous iterations. Students in schools will complete a pre/post survey online for the course in which they use virtual reality. Teachers will complete three interviews, pre/mid/post about their use of the technology. A new element that we hope to add is a group, informal discussion with students during our visit to the school (we try to visit each school one time during the school year) to chat about some of the findings and to hear students’ voices with  regard to virtual reality in their classrooms. As always, all data will be available to the school and teacher. And, as in previous iterations, foundry10 will work to assist teachers as they get VR up and running and will provide curricular support/suggestions if needed. </p>
<p>The recruitment process will run through May and our goal this year is to really expand our demographic groups to have a more representative sample as well as to provide a new technology to schools that might otherwise not have access to it. If a school does not have a computer capable of running an advanced headset we will work with the school to provide the computer as well.</p>
<p>We are excited to move ahead with the third year of the study!

<p>At foundry10, it’s important to us that we continue to work with teachers and educators with whom we have started a relationship and tailor our programming to their specific interests and needs. Kindergarten teacher Wendy Olson from Shoreline school district, for example, worked with foundry10 during the summer reading intervention and reached out to us for more classroom collaboration during the school year. She wanted to bring a teaching artist into her classroom during a reader’s theater unit, in order to enhance the student experience with that particular curriculum, and ultimately perform it for their peers and families. Foundry10 teaching artist, Meredith Berlin, joined up with Wendy for some pre-program, brief meetings to collaborate on ideas regarding how to enhance their curriculum and then launched their ideas for four class sessions and a final performance to much success with their students. </p>
<p>Wendy reflected, <i>“I can’t say enough about having Meredith be part of our classroom! She did a fantastic job of introducing the kids to some basic elements of acting, including stage presence, intonation, and expressions. She made the students feel comfortable expressing themselves while encouraging them to take appropriate risks. In addition to practicing our reader’s theater, the kids played games that sparked their imaginations and encourage creative expression. Having Meredith work with the kids was such a positive experience. The kids were drawn to her enthusiasm, kindness, patience, and creativity. I’d love to work with Meredith again and would encourage other educators to collaborate with foundry10 as they seek to bring the arts into their classrooms.”</i></p>
<p>We hope to work with Wendy again on another idea and will be sure to continue to prioritize those pre-program connections between teachers and teaching artists that seem key to successful collaborations.</p>

<p>In a cultural environment that necessitates awareness and advocacy, a group of teaching artists came together with an idea to respond to questions of social justice using our skills as theater artists. We set out to develop a social justice theater arts curriculum that could be tailored to the individual classroom teacher’s curriculum. We recognized the variable nature of different schools and communities, and therefore felt strongly that having a flexible model for curriculum was imperative. After months of communicating with potential schools we were able to find several different locations in which we could collaborate between teacher and teaching artist in individualized iterations of a social justice curricula.</p>
<p>Our goal was to promote awareness and empower the individual student voices by providing a creative approach to understanding and responding to issues related to social justice. Through the collaborative nature of the design, teachers also were able to express their voices, challenge themselves, and connect with students in new ways.</p>
<p>As always, there is a research component to our work. In particular, we are interested in investigating the following themes in the social justice theater programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>What agency do you feel you have to impact issues in the world around you?</li>
<li>In what ways, if any, did your understanding of social justice related issues change as a result of working together as a group to respond to an issue?</li>
<li>Do you feel more equipped to talk about or promote awareness of issues surrounding social justice?</li>
<li>Do you see social justice issues in your school that are ignored or not addressed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout our work, we will highlight five versions of the social justice program run in the 2016-2017 school year through a series of short reflections on our website. In addition, at the completion of all programs at the school year’s end, research will be compiled to share our findings and there will be a summary video giving samples of the students’ and teachers’ work.</p>
<p>Please stay tuned or subscribe to our newsletter, <a href="http://foundry10.org/contact-us/">on our contact us form</a>, for updates on this program, curriculum, and </p>

<p><a class="single-popup-image" href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/staged-reading-2.jpg"><img src="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/staged-reading-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1489" /></a></p>
<p>At foundry10, we’re interested in using the dramatic arts to develop creative leadership in students. This means, we believe, given the opportunity to really dive into a creative idea, students of all ages, can discover themselves as leaders not only in their confidence in their artistry but as leaders in their cultural community. </p>
<p>One such student we’ve had the pleasure to work with is a young woman, who approached us with an idea to write a new musical. Lydia Hayes, a 14-year-old musical writer, has been working with mentors at foundry10 for the past year on developing her new musical, “Behind the Glass.” In January 2017, she had her first staged table reading with a captive audience and a cast of talented student performers from the community. Village Theater Kidstage hosted the event in their second stage space. The evening was exciting, complete with stage lights, pizzas and snacks, surveys, and plenty of discussion and feedback. Lydia sang the songs she’s written, accompanied by Michael Nutting, her fantastic music composing mentor, and the event and discussion was facilitated by her script mentor and foundry10 dramatic arts programs director, Chelsea LeValley. Lydia invited the Village Theater Kidstage class of students who are working on a new musical together. She wanted their feedback since they’re also students writing a musical and are her age. In addition to that class, other students in the community who are writers or interested in being writers, including a member from the foundry10 New Musical Project team, and also the Village Theater staff who have a lot of experience with new musicals, attended her reading and gave much positive and critical feedback, much to Lydia’s eager acceptance. Below are some thoughts from Lydia on her experience:</p>

<p><i>“I&#8217;m learning about putting together all the pieces of creating a musical. How to write music and all about the components to a song and to tell a story through a song. I am also learning about the little details of writing a play, how to connect different scenes believably. And of course, how to combine songs and script. I wanted to write a musical because I wanted the experience but also, I&#8217;ve always seen musicals and thought to myself, I would have done it like this, or it should have been like, and when I heard this story, my first thought was that this would be a great musical. It was a really good experience to see and hear my script, with voices other than mine and what&#8217;s in my head, come to life. It made me think about things like, I thought it would come across like this, but when it was read it was completely different. Also, having a small group of people watch and give feedback was really important and helpful because they could hear it for the first time without knowing everything about the story and what everything means, so if they watched and got confused, that was very useful for me so that I know what needs to be more clear or explained. In the future for this script, I&#8217;d like to have another staged reading with the actors also singing the songs, get more feedback and make some edits, then have a full performance of it and maybe submit it to some different people and places and events.”</i></p>
<p>Lydia’s work is continuing to progress in her one-on-one sessions with her mentors as they incorporate feedback from the previous reading. The summer months plan to bring a workshop where the actors are taught the music and perform it as a staged reading for Lydia and the community to enjoy and give her further feedback on her work. Lydia is boldly stepping into her creative leadership, taking feedback from others, and synthesizing it into what she wants to incorporate into her art. Her confidence and ability to follow-through have been qualities artists who attended her reading expressed they found inspiring. We are looking forward to sharing her work with a larger community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Streets of Long Beach and Formula D: Students Getting Real-Life Racing Experience</h2>
<p>One important component of our automotive program involves opportunities for novices and experts to intersect. We want students to have the opportunity to learn from professionals in fields of interest so the students can better understand what a career might look like in that area. Last year we took high school students from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shockandaweracing/" target="_blank">Northshore Automotive program</a> to Laguna Seca to learn from racing experts at an IMSA race and found it to be a valuable experience for both the students and teachers. This year, we are gearing up to take automotive students from two programs, the Northshore Automotive program and the <a href="http://snoisletech.com/class/automotive-technology/" target="_blank">Sno-Isle Tech Center</a> to Long Beach, as well as their instructors to California for <a href="http://www.formulad.com/schedule/long-beach" target="_blank">“The Streets of Long Beach”</a> a Formula D racing event. </p>
<p>We surveyed students earlier this year to discover what types of automotive experiences would be most valuable for them to experience and learn about in more depth. They expressed a great deal of interest in the science and art of drift racing.  We are currently finishing up the design of this year’s trip to Long Beach, but it will involve opportunities to intersect with a variety of racing professionals, in technical and related fields, as well as a tour of the renowned Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>We have already closed the application cycle and are in the process of interviewing interested high school students.  We are really excited about this fantastic learning opportunity for the students and their teachers!</p>
