				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students in Rockettech are running a small business out of a high school tech classroom that provides web design and video production for area businesses in exchange for sizable donations. We wanted to study how this entrepreneurial group functions to determine how it could be replicated in other school environments.  Through visiting the program, interviewing and surveying students, talking with administrators and the instructor, Mark Suter, we were able to learn much more about the program and tracked it throughout the year.  </p>
<p>You can read our report on the program below:<br />
