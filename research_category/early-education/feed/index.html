				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Shoreline Kindergarten Readiness Program Report</h2>
<p>In Summer 2016, foundry10 collaborated with Shoreline School District to support a month-long kindergarten readiness program. Students coming in to kindergarten have a wide range of skill sets, with some students more prepared for the demands of kindergarten than others. To close the readiness gap, Shoreline approached us with the idea to design a summer class with the express purpose of preparing students for their first year in kindergarten. We decided to focus on boosting skills at this age, because of evidence that early intervention is particularly beneficial in closing achievement gaps. Elementary schools throughout the district identified students who were enrolled in kindergarten but hadnâ€™t previously had preschool, and invited a small number of these students to participate. One class of seven students participated in July before starting kindergarten the following month. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of our early education program, we partnered with Shoreline Children&#8217;s Center to try using story drama, the act of collaboratively creating stories in a group environment. Afterword, we surveyed the students and talked to the teachers to find out more about what they learned, what they thought of using story drama, and the impact it had on their class and students. This information was presented as part of an internal data-sharing event foundry10 holds each quarter called Data-Bytes.  Check out the slides below!</p>
<p>This data is from a 6-8 week residency using dramatic storytelling from two consecutive years.  The teaching arists in 2015 and 2016 were Chelsea LeValley and Amy Jurkieweiz, respectively.</p>
