				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the fall of the 2016-2017 school year, foundry10 ran robotics programs in two schools around Seattle: <a href="http://novahs.seattleschools.org/" target="_blank"
>The Nova Project</a> and <a href="https://www.seattlegirlsschool.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Girl&#8217;s School</a>.  We were interested in how exposure to our student-led robotics program improved student confidence with technology, productive risk-taking, and the perception of robotics as a community exercise.  We used a combination of likert-type scale survey questions and open-ended questions.  We found some gains in these areas, but hope to expand our sample size to improve our understanding of the impact that this experience has on students.</p>
