				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Dramatic Storytelling and Literacy</h1>
<p>This article describes a method of exploring and expanding literacy using dramatic storytelling techniques.  In this program, we paired drama teaching artists with teachers to engage young students in literacy-based exercises in a unique and fun way.  You can download the report here: <a href="http://foundry10.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dramatic-storytelling.pdf">Dramatic Storytelling and Literacy</a></p>
<p><b>Excerpt</b>: <i>We define dramatic storytelling as a collective, shared, collaborative storytelling with a connection to a real book. In our examples, the appropriate age range for this style of dramatic storytelling is traditionally suitable for ages three to seven. For our design, we utilized local dramatic teaching artists to come in and work alongside teachers in classrooms. Our goal was to have classroom teachers able to lead the exercises, in their regular classrooms, largely unassisted by the teaching artists, by the end of the program. In our model of dramatic storytelling, the primary storyteller, the teaching artist or adult, has the trajectory of the story arc based on an actual text, but the details are created by the children through a shared storytelling experience. Research suggests that reading and storytelling have a complementary relationship with one another with regard to language development and story comprehension; the two methods offer different benefits and combined with one another, provide an additive effect on overall reading development . (Isbell et al., 2004). Therefore, as a fusion of reading and storytelling, dramatic storytelling is likely able to strengthen both sets of skills.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the spring of 2016, foundry10 teamed up with Shoreline School District to provide a week-long math and reading program that had an integrated drama component with the goal of enhancing student skills and motivation. Shoreline Schools Foundation and foundry10 partnered to create an original program at Parkwood Elementary School Spring Break 2016 where we joined creative/dramatic arts with traditional CORE curriculum for 5-days over Spring Break. Students testing at the cusp of being able to pass the SBAC in April were invited to the week-long intervention. Four teachers were recruited for the program that targeted 3rd through 6th grade students. From April 18-22, foundry10 instructors provided classroom instruction, including 20 hours of integrated and direct instruction with drama to explore the content and structure of stories. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2015, foundry10 partnered with the Shoreline School District to offer the dramatic arts as part of a summer intervention for incoming third grade students testing below average in reading. We wanted to see if integrating the performing arts into this intervention would improve reading scores and help students feel more comfortable with themselves and their reading abilities.</p>
<p>You can find a breakdown and some of the results below:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In summer 2016, we took our knowledge and skillset in dramatic arts to the International Conference on Imagination and Education.</p>
<p>After writing a paper and getting accepted as a 45-minute workshop, we headed up to Vancouver, BC, for a three-day conference with other educators from around the country. In our workshop time, we drew in many teachers looking to find out more about how we used the dramatic arts in elementary classrooms. We had people joining all throughout the session when walking by and seeing us up on our feet, engaging physical movement and imaginations to tell a story, and laughing!</p>
<p>Many educators expressed interest in bringing foundry10 to their classroom and we encouraged them to continue to reach out to us with questions about the curriculum they experienced with us that day. Many participants cited that they planned to use the material in their traditional classrooms and after the session had commenced people stayed to ask specific questions about how they could tailor the dramatic arts curriculum to a particular topic or unit they were currently working with in class. The teachers came from all sorts of backgrounds and experiences. Some taught pre-school but the range ran through post-secondary, all were present with us and we spent a good deal of time discussing opportunities to scaffold the activities we demonstrated for the varying age groups.</p>
<p>Teachers were willing participants and jumped right into the playful approach to the dramatic arts exercises and therefore stayed with us enough to ask insightful questions when we shared our research findings from various programs. A keynote speaker from the weekend spoke about adding an element of “WONDER” to the work we do with imaginative education, and we found that WONDER is a theme throughout all of the most inspiring dramatic arts work in the classroom.</p>
