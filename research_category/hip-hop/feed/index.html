				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the spring of 2016, foundry10 teamed up with Shoreline School District to provide a week-long math and reading program that had an integrated drama component with the goal of enhancing student skills and motivation. Shoreline Schools Foundation and foundry10 partnered to create an original program at Parkwood Elementary School Spring Break 2016 where we joined creative/dramatic arts with traditional CORE curriculum for 5-days over Spring Break. Students testing at the cusp of being able to pass the SBAC in April were invited to the week-long intervention. Four teachers were recruited for the program that targeted 3rd through 6th grade students. From April 18-22, foundry10 instructors provided classroom instruction, including 20 hours of integrated and direct instruction with drama to explore the content and structure of stories. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working with dance students, we frequently encounter performance anxiety and frustration. However, we believe that encountering and overcoming these difficult feelings is one of the biggest challenges through which Hip Hop, and dance in general, creates value for students of all skill levels. Now, after nearly three years of dance programs, the team at foundry10 has put together a retrospective and qualitative view on how frustration and dance mix together to create confidence, discipline, and resilience in dancers.</p>
