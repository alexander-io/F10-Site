				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the very first programs we ran was focused on a group of 5 female teens and their drive to try new things. Along with foundry10, the girls tried out a number of new and unusual activities ranging from skateboarding to blacksmithing to paintball. We talked to the girls about the experiences and how trying new things affected their view on the world and the choices available to them.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2014, we shared this information with the Imaginative Education Research Group. You can find our slides with our findings below.</p>
