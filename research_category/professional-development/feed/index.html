				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shoreline Schools Foundation and foundry10 partnered to create an original program at Parkwood Elementary, during spring break 2016. We joined creative/dramatic arts with traditional CORE curriculum for 5-days over Spring Break. Students testing at the cusp of being able to pass the SBAC in April were invited to the week-long intervention. In this program, dedicated teachers were paired with passionate teaching artists for ten full hours of preparation in the months leading up to the week-long experience. We found that providing this amount of time for creating imaginative curriculum between two different talented and capable educators would provide the unique context for a week-long break camp where traditional classroom curriculum could be experienced in an artful way.</p>
