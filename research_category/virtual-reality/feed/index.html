				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 2015-2016 school year, foundry10 put VR in the classrooms of 390 students in the US and Canada.  Our objective was to collaborate with teachers to find out more about what really happens when VR enters the classroom.  Through a series of surveys and interviews, we gathered data at the beginning, middle and end of the program in each school.  The teachers used the technology in the way that made sense for them and their students, and as a result we were granted a view at a wide variety of different ideas for how VR can enhance classroom learning.</p>
<p>Below are our initial reports,the dataset that includes the anonymized survey responses from the students in the program, and a brief description of the program itself.  Please take a look and <a href="../contact-us/">reach out to us</a> if you have any thoughts or questions.</p>

<p>Exploring technology is a vital part of modern day students’ educational experiences. Often, however, schools come in on the tail-end of an emerging technology, thereby limiting students’ opportunities for exposure and skill development. Advanced technology can be considered a type of cultural capital which students can utilize in order to progress and navigate future career pathways. Virtual reality is one such advanced technology, now readily commercially available, which is making its way into classrooms. Our recent research focusing on the implementation of VR in classrooms provides information about how educators can make VR accessible to students. Access in virtually reality can be considered through multiple lenses and we discuss a few of them here. The first considers learning styles and nontraditional engagement, the second discusses access to a global education, and the third revolves around issues of social justice. We feel these areas are highly relevant considerations for educators as they consider the use of virtual reality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Excerpt:</i><br />
Virtual reality is starting to make its way into classrooms across the country. Although the VR content itself is engaging and interesting in its own right, VR has much more potential for learning. Our work with students in seven different schools last year showed us that it is not just content consumption and gaming that kids are thinking about when they consider VR. Though students definitely told us how much they liked being on a shipwrecked boat deep under the sea, or trying to communicate with one another as they solved a challenging puzzle while immersed in a different world, we were intrigued by the number of students who really engaged with VR in a much broader sense. Whether it was as artistic visionaries creating 3D art pieces, working in VR game engines to design content, creating 360 videos for other students to watch, or even exploring the functionality of VR itself, there was a great deal of learning going on. In fact, virtual reality seemed to tap into student interest in computer science in new ways. As this technology becomes more accessible to schools, we’d like educators to consider the breadth of learning that can occur within VR.</p>

Virtual Reality’s entry into the commercial space has generated a lot excitement for gamers but also for educators. After looking for some concrete information about what it looked like to put VR in schools and finding very little, we decided to go ahead and do an exploratory study ourselves. We wondered, “what are some things people should know about putting VR in schools?” In the 2015-2016 school year, we partnered with 7 schools across North America to look at some trends and best practices for using VR in schools, particularly with advanced headsets such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, and we learned a great deal. Though more formal examples of our findings are coming soon, we wanted to share some highlights because it turns out,putting VR in schools is quite different from other forms of media.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Abstract:</i><br />
In this study we sought to investigate how teachers implement virtual reality into the classroom. Participants were seven middle and high school teachers who were given virtual reality hardware to augment their teaching. Pre and post interviews were conducted and analyzed to understand how teachers implemented VR, technological hurdles they encountered and how they incorporated content. Results revealed how teachers overcame hardware challenges, managed their classrooms, the importance of scaffolding the learning, and interesting effects on classroom collaboration. A key finding was that more content is needed in order to make VR a truly useful mechanism for learning in the non-tech classrooms but content creation is a viable option for tech-based classes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing advanced technology into a classroom requires thoughtful planning and implementation, especially with something as personally impactful as virtual reality. Throughout our work with schools across North America, we have been examining some case studies of VR kits in real classrooms. Our VR program has examined various combinations of hardware, software, subject matter, age groups, and locales to see what happens when VR gets into the hands of students and teachers. Through our interviews with teachers and surveys with students, we have uncovered many promising opportunities, but also some concerns that lead us to carefully consider the role of VR in education. We present considerations, challenges, and our experience in three key areas: ethical VR use, pedagogy/content, and immersive communities in classrooms. We offer discussion points about both positive and negative impacts of VR, and what we can do to maximize its usefulness in creating valuable learning for students.</p>
