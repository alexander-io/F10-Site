				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This report covers what we have learned over the past 3 years running digital audio programs in schools, with community partners, and on our own.</p>
<p>We have been running digital audio programs since 2014, and have explored many different ways of offering and structuring the courses. While there is still so much to learn about the subject, the audio team at foundry10 has put together a report showcasing the work they have done and what they have learned about how high school students interact with digital audio. Please read the report below if you want to find out more about our audio program, its history, and what we have learned so far.</p>
