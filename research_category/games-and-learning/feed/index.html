				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Abstract</i></p>
<p>The popularity of multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games provides an opportunity to examine how cognitive skills are linked with changes in player performance within a team-based game genre. There is evidence that video game experience in other genres is connected with specific cognitive skills such as visuospatial attention and working memory capacity. Links have also been observed outside of video games such as numerical intelligence being correlated with the performance of chess experts. In the present study, we investigated whether numerical and working memory ability measured at an initial time-point predicted changes in MOBA skill and gameplay frequency measured five months later. We observed that participants who scored higher on a number processing task had greater improvements in MOBA skill and that this link depended on the social context of the gameplay. Specifically, numerical skill was linked to player rankings generated from matches where they were paired with random individuals; no connection was observed with gameplay that took place with a familiar set of teammates. The results of the present study extend previous research indicating video gameplay is linked to specific cognitive skills, in the case of MOBAs being numerical processing. We suggest that the difference in the connection with number ability to gameplay with novel and familiar players is in line with evidence that the importance of individual performance and the sense of achievement can be reduced in team settings. We suggest that future research should examine what types of quantitative abilities are indicative of MOBA skill and the impact of those factors relative to social skills.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>From the article:</i></p>
<p>Art and creative expression have an interesting way of weaving in and out of classrooms, offering students the opportunity to explore their own ideas and minds. Video games are no different, and while most of the discussion about their use in classrooms centers on play, we at foundry10 wanted to examine the value of making games. Through easily accessible programs such as Scratch and Gamemaker, students from early elementary up through college are creating games and learning while doing it.</p>
<p>We gathered surveys from 107 game design and development professionals and 300 middle school students, before and after a game development class, about the value of teaching game development in a middle school class. Then we compared the responses of the 7th- and 8th-graders with what the game developers said they felt would be important about making games. We hope this information will help teachers who are constructing game development classes, and show the broader view of the value inherent in game development that professional game makers can provide.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Introduction:</i><br />
It is no secret that there is a large and growing emphasis on technological literacy in schools. From laptops and tablets to cameras and even virtual reality, creating competitive and job-ready minds seems to require increasingly pervasive technology education. While it is important for students to be tech-literate, we at foundry10 feel it can be all too easy to lose sight of the value that comes from working outside the bounds of technology, and into the analog world. When it comes to games, this is especially true. With flashy graphics and pop culture on their side, video games tend to be the first thing that comes to mind when people think games in the classroom. So we wondered what would happen if we took making games back to its roots on tabletops, and see how that differs from making video games.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Abstract</i><br />
Teaching students to create video games provides an engaging opportunity to introduce computer programming concepts and computational thinking in a constructionist learning environment. In addition, video game design and development in the classroom teaches valuable skills including design thinking, problem solving, iterative design, and storytelling. Video games embody a type of cultural capital that makes content more accessible and interesting to many children. Currently, there are limited options for students at the middle school level to partake in courses in video game design and development, though research suggests there are benefits to engaging students in this type of design work and participatory culture. We explore the research findings and provide an overview of a public middle school program that has developed a curriculum in game design and development for seventh and eighth grade students, and look at implementation strategies for schools.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Abstract:</i><br />
With the games industry now rivaling the size of Hollywood, students are increasingly setting their career-sights on jobs making games. The professional and cultural relevance of video games are leading educators to find the elements of games and game creation that prepare interested students for a potential career, and also provide skill development and value to everyone else. Programs that run today are largely experimental and seeking out the balance between the fun of games and the learning that comes from them. Our work in the games industry, and the topic of this panel, is focused on the act of game creation and three primary questions: what does it mean to make a game? How accessible is game creation to students? And how do we address equity issues in games? We plan to share the insights we have gained through our research and the programs we have run, all focused on finding out what really happens when kids make games.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Individuals who have domain-specific knowledge, such as chess players and dancers, have been found to use schemas to organize and anticipate information. We examined whether multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game players use a similar strategy. Participants were presented with a memory task where they recalled the status of game features as displayed on a mini-map. The task contained two conditions: a condition where game features were arranged in a manner consistent with gameplay and a condition where game features were arranged in a random manner. Recall accuracy for highly structured game features was affected by whether a mini-map was consistent or arbitrarily arranged and varied with participants’ MOBA expertise. This is in line with previous expertise research that has found that knowledge of underlying probability structures of events contained within schemas is indicative of domain-specific knowledge. This suggests that MOBA players can be used to study skill acquisition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Introduction</i><br />
The commercial game, Portal 2, is a puzzle-based game in which the user solves puzzles presented in a series of “test chambers.” Upon the successful completion of a puzzle the user is allowed to exit that particular chamber and thus makes progress within the game. The associated level design tool, The Puzzle Maker, enables users to create additional rooms (test chambers) for the game.</p>
<p>The Broken Rooms lesson was designed by Geoff Moore and Lisa Castaneda so students would manipulate pre-built rooms, however, the rooms had inherent design errors and were therefore unplayable as presented. Essentially, the rooms were erroneous examples of how a real room would work. Students would need to identify and then fix the rooms at the design level so they would become playable. The task of fixing the rooms would be too simple for students if they were allowed to use any tool available in their solutions. Therefore, additional constraints were imposed upon each broken room that limited the options students had for fixing the room. It was expected that students would find it much more difficult to fix a room if there were constraints involved and thus the cognitive demand of the lesson would be higher. The link for the lesson is included in the reference section.</p>
<p>This paper is an exploration of a few general questions the author had about using The Broken Rooms with middle school students. Would the use of erroneous examples challenge the students in a different way than simple level-design problems? Would student knowledge from fixing the broken rooms enable them to effectively create their own broken rooms? Does differential skill-level within the game affect the problem-solving skills required in the lesson? Research on erroneous example use in math classrooms, particularly through the use of video games, is still limited. It is hoped that the observations from this exploratory teacher research will be beneficial to future work in this area.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this study we evaluated a novel approach for examining the link between gaming expertise and cognitive skills, and the value of recruiting and running participants at a MOBA gaming tournament. Participants completed a set of cognitive tasks that measured spatial working and long term (location) memory, basic cognitive processing, and gaming experience. Comparable reliability on the working memory task and results in line with previous research on the location memory task indicated the data collected was valid and reliable. We observed a significant relation between gaming experience and response time on the location memory task. We discuss that conducting gaming research at a tournament is a valid way of collecting data for a gaming expertise study while providing a range of gaming expertise that may not be available when recruiting at college campuses. Furthermore, our results extend previous gaming research that suggests that individual differences in gaming experience are correlated with the speed of recalling spatial information from long term memory.</p>
